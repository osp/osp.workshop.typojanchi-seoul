As the copyright holders, we open up these materials for your to use if you want to.

Different types of materials have different licenses. This is to be accomodating to different use cases and cultures that have arisen around different digital formats.

The licenses we use are copyleft. That means that you are free to reuse, modify and redistribute our materials, and that you are also allowed to make money doing so. You have to, however, redistribute your own variants under the same license. This means that the ecology of sharing is stimulated.

All code written in programming languages is licensed under the Affero GPL v3. This is a variant of the GPLv3 copyleft license, that makes sure that deploying your code online also counts as distribution, and thus, as an incentive to re-share your modified code.

All texts written in natural languages, and all drawings and visual designs, are dual licensed under the Free Art License and Creative Commons Share Alike. 
- The Free Art License, because we feel that the spirit of its beautiful and simple seems the closest as the way we think creation can be shared. 
- Creative Commons, because a lot of people take part in this ecosystem. 
If you modify our work, you are free to license your version under either of them (or both).

All original typefaces are licensed under the SIL Open Font License. This copyleft license is the first license written specifically for fonts. If we base our font on an existing font, we reutilise the original license. The metadata of the font is conclusive in this case.

Not all files in the repository might be copyrighted by us. For example, posters often include logos from supporting institutions. Folders with documentation might include images made by others. In these cases, a separate README.txt in the folder will inform you of the rights situation.

Also note that while we are the owners of the copyright of all the original works contained in the repository, there are other rights that we can’t necessarily control. For instance, a copyleft photograph can still be subject to the personality rights of the persons depicted.

As our Lafkon friends state : "This work contains material which may be subject to trademark laws in one or more jurisdictions. Before using this content, please ensure that you have the right to use it under the laws which apply in the circumstances of your intended use."

And they explain it with "We try to keep some way of a sense-making  differentiation for different copyrights of different files. this  disclaimer is like the standard disclaimer for files that contain things  we've not created ourselves (like some logos) or we are not sure  wether to put in under our standard licensing. Since we do  not want to exclude these files from download, we put the disclaimer."

If you are not certain of the license of a file that you want to re-use,  please feel free to ask us directly by email: <mail@osp.constantvzw.org>.
