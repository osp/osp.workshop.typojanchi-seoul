Workshop
------

By looking at the inner workings of digital text recognition software know as OCR (Optical Character Recognition), there seems to be a space in which we can put comprehension aside, and where we could be able to observe typography in its shapes, before making out it's specificities, or even it's meaning.
By declutching some of our digital habits, and taking time to understand and retrace processes that OCR uses to look at shapes, step by step, and over time working out which are characters, which are words, and what they correspond to, this software embodies a digital way of learning to read.
We believe there is a lot to take from this, a lot we, as type enthusiasts, can grasp on to. Could we propose a patient manual reverse engineering process of the digitally possible methods to work towards a deeper understanding of our typographic languages and our restitution of the embedable links between content and its forms?
